# Java Operations Calculator

I completed this school project in 2019 to gain hands-on experience with polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces, and inheritance in Java. It computes the result of a calculator style tree of operations and includes a small GUI to demonstrate the structure of this operations. The class names are in German.

## Motivation

Learning about polymorphism and other object-oriented programming concepts can be challenging. To facilitate this, I developed a Java program that calculates a variety of operations, providing a practical way to understand these concepts. The program allows users to manually compose operations in a tree like structure and observe how they are executed through a graphical user interface to compute the result.

## Features

The project is built around a tree like structure with the base class `Operand` as the parent of other abstract classes, which in turn are the parent classes of all operations. Here are some of the key features:

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform standard operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **Advanced Functions**: Includes more complex functions like logarithms, power, and the root.
3. **Additional Functions**: Features trigonometric functions, absolute value, signum, and integer value conversion.
